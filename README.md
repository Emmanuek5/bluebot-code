### Custom discord Bot

This is a custom discord bot that I made for my server. It has a few commands that I use for my server. I will be adding more commands as I go along.

## Commands

### !ping

This command will return a pong message. This is just a test command to make sure the bot is working.

### !help

This command will return a list of commands that the bot has.

### !add

This command will add two numbers together. It will return the sum of the two numbers.

## Installation
